What did I do well this sprint?

I think I did well in understanding the general concepts and I can see the potential in all of the code

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I am struggling with correct syntax - I understand what I want the functions to do - I'm just unsure as to how to write it correctly. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

More discipline, More effort, don't stop moving.
